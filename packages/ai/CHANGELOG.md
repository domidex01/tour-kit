## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 8a443fb: `AiChatToggle` accepts a `style` prop merged over its fixed-position defaults,
  so the launcher can be nudged away from other bottom-corner UI (framework dev
  indicators, another FAB) without re-implementing it.

  `AdoptionTable` rows no longer show a hover-background highlight by default —
  the table is display-only (no row click handler) and the highlight read as
  "clickable". Opt back in with the row variant's `hover` where rows are
  genuinely interactive.

- ef31ce6: chore: move 7 runtime dependencies into the pnpm catalog

  `@floating-ui/react`, `class-variance-authority`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`,
  `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `@mui/base`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge` are now
  resolved via `catalog:` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. No version changes; no
  behavior changes. Cuts future bumps from a 9-file find-and-replace to a
  one-line edit and prevents accidental drift.

### Minor Changes

- d777614: Phase 8 dashboard-next QA pass: analytics event coverage, a11y fixes, autostart correctness, and watermark visual polish.

  **Analytics event coverage.** New `TourEventName` values — `announcement_shown`, `announcement_dismissed`, `announcement_completed`, `checklist_task_completed`, `checklist_completed`, and `schedule_evaluated` — are now emitted by their respective providers when an analytics plugin is registered. `consolePlugin` will surface them as `[tour-kit]` groups; production destinations (`@tour-kit/analytics`) receive them via the same `track()` interface.

  **Tour autostart respects completed tours.** `<TourProvider>` no longer auto-restarts a tour that the user has already completed (or skipped) across route navigations. State is sourced from `usePersistence` when `persistence.trackCompleted` is enabled, and `ADD_COMPLETED` / `ADD_SKIPPED` reducers now dedupe to prevent the list from growing on repeat dispatches.

  **Announcement dialog a11y.** `AnnouncementModal` now forwards `aria-describedby` when a description exists and renders content with `asDialogContent` so Radix's title/description requirements are satisfied — eliminates the `DialogTitle is required` and `DialogDescription` console warnings.

  **Schedule diagnostics.** `useSchedule` exposes the evaluation `reason` (`outside_window`, `holiday`, `before_start_date`, `after_end_date`, etc.) on the hook return so consumers can render or log why a banner is hidden without inspecting the schedule shape themselves.

  **License watermark refresh.** The unlicensed badge now renders the User Tour Kit logo (14×14 SVG) in place of the amber dot — same singleton, same portal, same `pointer-events: none` wrapper, just a clearer visual signal.

  **Install graph: `@tour-kit/analytics` peer → direct dependency.** `@tour-kit/adoption`, `@tour-kit/announcements`, `@tour-kit/checklists`, `@tour-kit/hints`, `@tour-kit/react`, and `@tour-kit/scheduling` now declare `@tour-kit/analytics` as a regular dependency rather than an optional peer. Consumers no longer need to install `@tour-kit/analytics` manually for analytics events to be available — the package ships with each consumer that emits them. No runtime behaviour change for consumers who already installed it.

### Minor Changes

- 2f1a88d: License gate is now soft by default for Pro packages

  `<LicenseGate>` is rewritten as the canonical internal soft gate. It now reads `LicenseContext` directly (no longer throws when used outside `<LicenseProvider>`), always renders `children`, and on non-localhost hosts without a valid license layers a single small `Tour Kit · Unlicensed · Buy license` portal badge plus a dev-only console warning over the top. `fallback` continues to hard-replace children, but only when a provider is mounted and the state is gated.

  `<LicenseWatermark>` is replaced. It is no longer a full-screen rotated `UNLICENSED` overlay — it is now a small fixed bottom-right badge rendered into `document.body` via a portal, with `pointer-events: none` on the wrapper and `pointer-events: auto` on the link so it never blocks app clicks. Multiple mounted instances coalesce into a single visible badge via singleton ownership transfer (StrictMode-safe). Badge clicks open pricing with UTM params and emit `unlicensed_badge_clicked` via `window.gtag` or `window.dataLayer`.

  All 8 Pro packages (`@tour-kit/adoption`, `@tour-kit/announcements`, `@tour-kit/checklists`, `@tour-kit/ai`, `@tour-kit/surveys`, `@tour-kit/scheduling`, `@tour-kit/analytics`, `@tour-kit/media`) now wrap their provider/components with `<LicenseGate require="pro">` instead of `<ProGate package="...">`. The practical effect: a developer can install a Pro package, push a preview deploy, and demo the real UI to teammates before purchasing — no more hard-placeholder dead end on preview, staging, or production.

  `<ProGate>` is **not** removed. It remains exported from `@tour-kit/license` for downstream consumers who want a hard-placeholder gate, but Tour Kit's own Pro packages no longer use it internally.

  Commercial URLs aligned to `usertourkit.com` across `LicenseWarning`, `ProGate`, every Pro package `LICENSE.md`, the docs API reference, the pricing FAQ, and the license package README/CLAUDE.md.

### Patch Changes

- 6e77a3b: Point each package's `homepage` field at https://usertourkit.com/ so the "Homepage" link in the npm sidebar opens the docs site instead of the GitHub README.

### Minor Changes

- 46f2039: Unify all packages to 0.8.0 ahead of the 1.0 milestone. Includes a small bug-hunter sweep:

  - `@tour-kit/announcements`: clear pending "show next in queue" `setTimeout`s on provider unmount; previously fire-and-forget timers could call `show()` against an unmounted tree.
  - `@tour-kit/scheduling`: drop unreachable re-exports (`getCurrentMinutesInTimezone`, `toMinutesSinceMidnight`, `getDateRangeStart`, `getNextTimeRangeStart`, `getNextAllowedDay`) from the inner `utils/` barrel. Symbols remain exported from their source modules where internal callers need them.
  - `@tour-kit/react`: silence a `useSemanticElements` warning on `TourProgress` text variant (`<output>` is incompatible with the existing `div`-based prop type).

### Patch Changes

- 6d7f23f: Launch-hardening audit fixes A2–A5:

  - announcements: stabilize the toast auto-dismiss `setInterval` so it no longer re-arms on every parent render (audit A2).
  - ai: declare the chat message list with explicit `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-atomic="false"`, `aria-relevant="additions text"`, and `aria-busy` driven by streaming status so screen readers announce streaming tokens reliably (audit A3).
  - announcements: render the spotlight overlay as a real `<button>` when `closeOnOverlayClick` is enabled, otherwise an inert `aria-hidden` div — element shape is now statically coherent and Enter/Space activation works through the native button (audit A4).
  - surveys: trap focus inside `SurveyPopover`, dismiss with reason `"escape_key"` when Escape is pressed, and restore focus to the anchor on close (audit A5).

- a35d469: NPM SEO + README accuracy pass. Pure metadata and documentation — no public API changes.

  **`package.json` (11 packages, license unchanged)** — descriptions trimmed to ≤150 chars (front-loading the primary keyword phrase before npm search-card truncation) and keyword arrays reordered with high-intent long-tail terms first (`react-onboarding`, `nextjs-onboarding`, `onboarding-wizard`, `onboarding-flow`, `react-product-tour`, `product-demo`, `feature-hint`, `in-app-survey`, etc.). Generic single-word keywords (`react`, `tour`) deprioritized; `*-alternative` keywords retained or expanded.

  **READMEs (all 12 packages)** — rewritten on a unified template:

  - H1 + keyword-phrase tagline + badge row (npm version, downloads, bundle, types, license)
  - "Alternative to" line owning competitor-name SEO surface (`react-joyride-alternative`, `intro-js-alternative`, `shepherd-alternative`, etc.)
  - Quick Start that compiles against the actual exports
  - Comparison table vs major alternatives
  - Complete API reference verified against `src/index.ts` for every package — no fictional or missing exports
  - Cross-links to sibling `@tour-kit/*` npm pages
  - Docs link migrated from the broken `tour-kit.dev` / `tourkit.dev` to the live `usertourkit.com`
  - Correct license disclosure (MIT for free packages / Pro tier for proprietary)

  **Accuracy bugs fixed in the rewrite** (none of these compiled before):

  - `core` — Quick Start used `createTour({ id, steps })` and `createStep({ id, target, content: { title, description } })`, neither of which match the real signatures (`createTour(steps, options?)`, `createStep(target, content, options?)`). Rewritten using `createNamedTour` / `createNamedStep` for explicit IDs. Hook list was missing 4 public hooks (`useAdvanceOn`, `useBranch`, `useRoutePersistence`, `useUILibrary`) and 11 public utilities; all now documented.
  - `checklists` — referenced non-existent `<ChecklistItem>` (real export is `<ChecklistTask>`), `useChecklistItem` (real: `useTask`), `useChecklistProgress` (real: `useChecklistsProgress`), and claimed MIT licensing despite being a Pro package.
  - `analytics` — referenced non-existent `createAnalyticsPlugin`, `createSegmentPlugin`, and `useTrack`. Real plugin exports are `consolePlugin`, `posthogPlugin`, `mixpanelPlugin`, `amplitudePlugin`, `googleAnalyticsPlugin`. Real hooks are `useAnalytics` and `useAnalyticsOptional`. License also corrected from MIT to Pro.
  - `adoption`, `core`, `analytics`, `checklists`, `license` — broken docs URLs (`tour-kit.dev` / `tourkit.dev`) updated to `usertourkit.com`.
  - `media`, `surveys`, `scheduling` — these had no README at all; new ones added.

  This is the foundation for the npm-search SEO push: with corrected metadata and accurate, intent-rich READMEs, npm full-text indexing surfaces the packages for `react-onboarding`, `nextjs-onboarding`, `onboarding-wizard`, and competitor-alternative searches that were previously dead air.

### Patch Changes

- 04520d7: Phase 1 of the code-health pass: hoist `cn()` into `@tour-kit/core` and minify `@tour-kit/adoption`'s build.

  **`@tour-kit/core`** — new public export `cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]): string` (re-exported from the package root). Composes `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`, byte-compatible with the eight prior duplicates. `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` are now declared `dependencies` of `@tour-kit/core` and listed as tsup externals so they remain peer-resolved.

  **`@tour-kit/ai`** — `@tour-kit/core` is no longer an optional peer; it is now a required workspace dependency. Apps that installed `@tour-kit/ai` without `@tour-kit/core` will need to add it (or rely on the auto-install from this dependency).

  **`@tour-kit/media`** — adds `@tour-kit/core` as a workspace dependency (was previously absent; cn was sourced from a local copy).

  **All consumer packages** — switched to `import { cn } from '@tour-kit/core'`. No public API changes for consumers. The 8 duplicate `cn()` implementations (7 × `lib/utils.ts` + `checklists/components/cn.ts`) have been removed.

  **`@tour-kit/adoption`** — `tsup.config.ts` flips `minify: true` (matching the other 11 configs). The bundled `dist/index.js` shrinks from 50,131 → 25,758 raw bytes (-49%) and 10,334 → 7,831 gzipped bytes (-24%). The `'use client'` directive is now prepended in `onSuccess` so it survives minification.
