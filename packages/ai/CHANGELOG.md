# @tour-kit/ai

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 46f2039: Unify all packages to 0.8.0 ahead of the 1.0 milestone. Includes a small bug-hunter sweep:

  - `@tour-kit/announcements`: clear pending "show next in queue" `setTimeout`s on provider unmount; previously fire-and-forget timers could call `show()` against an unmounted tree.
  - `@tour-kit/scheduling`: drop unreachable re-exports (`getCurrentMinutesInTimezone`, `toMinutesSinceMidnight`, `getDateRangeStart`, `getNextTimeRangeStart`, `getNextAllowedDay`) from the inner `utils/` barrel. Symbols remain exported from their source modules where internal callers need them.
  - `@tour-kit/react`: silence a `useSemanticElements` warning on `TourProgress` text variant (`<output>` is incompatible with the existing `div`-based prop type).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [46f2039]

### Patch Changes

- 6d7f23f: Launch-hardening audit fixes A2–A5:

  - announcements: stabilize the toast auto-dismiss `setInterval` so it no longer re-arms on every parent render (audit A2).
  - ai: declare the chat message list with explicit `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-atomic="false"`, `aria-relevant="additions text"`, and `aria-busy` driven by streaming status so screen readers announce streaming tokens reliably (audit A3).
  - announcements: render the spotlight overlay as a real `<button>` when `closeOnOverlayClick` is enabled, otherwise an inert `aria-hidden` div — element shape is now statically coherent and Enter/Space activation works through the native button (audit A4).
  - surveys: trap focus inside `SurveyPopover`, dismiss with reason `"escape_key"` when Escape is pressed, and restore focus to the anchor on close (audit A5).

- a35d469: NPM SEO + README accuracy pass. Pure metadata and documentation — no public API changes.

  **`package.json` (11 packages, license unchanged)** — descriptions trimmed to ≤150 chars (front-loading the primary keyword phrase before npm search-card truncation) and keyword arrays reordered with high-intent long-tail terms first (`react-onboarding`, `nextjs-onboarding`, `onboarding-wizard`, `onboarding-flow`, `react-product-tour`, `product-demo`, `feature-hint`, `in-app-survey`, etc.). Generic single-word keywords (`react`, `tour`) deprioritized; `*-alternative` keywords retained or expanded.

  **READMEs (all 12 packages)** — rewritten on a unified template:

  - H1 + keyword-phrase tagline + badge row (npm version, downloads, bundle, types, license)
  - "Alternative to" line owning competitor-name SEO surface (`react-joyride-alternative`, `intro-js-alternative`, `shepherd-alternative`, etc.)
  - Quick Start that compiles against the actual exports
  - Comparison table vs major alternatives
  - Complete API reference verified against `src/index.ts` for every package — no fictional or missing exports
  - Cross-links to sibling `@tour-kit/*` npm pages
  - Docs link migrated from the broken `tour-kit.dev` / `tourkit.dev` to the live `usertourkit.com`
  - Correct license disclosure (MIT for free packages / Pro tier for proprietary)

  **Accuracy bugs fixed in the rewrite** (none of these compiled before):

  - `core` — Quick Start used `createTour({ id, steps })` and `createStep({ id, target, content: { title, description } })`, neither of which match the real signatures (`createTour(steps, options?)`, `createStep(target, content, options?)`). Rewritten using `createNamedTour` / `createNamedStep` for explicit IDs. Hook list was missing 4 public hooks (`useAdvanceOn`, `useBranch`, `useRoutePersistence`, `useUILibrary`) and 11 public utilities; all now documented.
  - `checklists` — referenced non-existent `<ChecklistItem>` (real export is `<ChecklistTask>`), `useChecklistItem` (real: `useTask`), `useChecklistProgress` (real: `useChecklistsProgress`), and claimed MIT licensing despite being a Pro package.
  - `analytics` — referenced non-existent `createAnalyticsPlugin`, `createSegmentPlugin`, and `useTrack`. Real plugin exports are `consolePlugin`, `posthogPlugin`, `mixpanelPlugin`, `amplitudePlugin`, `googleAnalyticsPlugin`. Real hooks are `useAnalytics` and `useAnalyticsOptional`. License also corrected from MIT to Pro.
  - `adoption`, `core`, `analytics`, `checklists`, `license` — broken docs URLs (`tour-kit.dev` / `tourkit.dev`) updated to `usertourkit.com`.
  - `media`, `surveys`, `scheduling` — these had no README at all; new ones added.

  This is the foundation for the npm-search SEO push: with corrected metadata and accurate, intent-rich READMEs, npm full-text indexing surfaces the packages for `react-onboarding`, `nextjs-onboarding`, `onboarding-wizard`, and competitor-alternative searches that were previously dead air.

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 04520d7: Phase 1 of the code-health pass: hoist `cn()` into `@tour-kit/core` and minify `@tour-kit/adoption`'s build.

  **`@tour-kit/core`** — new public export `cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]): string` (re-exported from the package root). Composes `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`, byte-compatible with the eight prior duplicates. `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` are now declared `dependencies` of `@tour-kit/core` and listed as tsup externals so they remain peer-resolved.

  **`@tour-kit/ai`** — `@tour-kit/core` is no longer an optional peer; it is now a required workspace dependency. Apps that installed `@tour-kit/ai` without `@tour-kit/core` will need to add it (or rely on the auto-install from this dependency).

  **`@tour-kit/media`** — adds `@tour-kit/core` as a workspace dependency (was previously absent; cn was sourced from a local copy).

  **All consumer packages** — switched to `import { cn } from '@tour-kit/core'`. No public API changes for consumers. The 8 duplicate `cn()` implementations (7 × `lib/utils.ts` + `checklists/components/cn.ts`) have been removed.

  **`@tour-kit/adoption`** — `tsup.config.ts` flips `minify: true` (matching the other 11 configs). The bundled `dist/index.js` shrinks from 50,131 → 25,758 raw bytes (-49%) and 10,334 → 7,831 gzipped bytes (-24%). The `'use client'` directive is now prepended in `onSuccess` so it survives minification.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- a7a0840: chore: publish Pro packages as public on npm

  Flip `publishConfig.access` from `restricted` to `public`. Pro-tier gating stays at runtime via `@tour-kit/license` + Polar.sh keys (watermark + console warning on unlicensed use), matching the documented "no hard block" licensing model. No code or API changes.

  - @tour-kit/license@1.0.2

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 940847a: chore: update GitHub owner from `DomiDex` to `domidex01` in package metadata

  Updates `repository.url`, `homepage`, `bugs.url`, and LICENSE copyright to reflect the new GitHub account. No runtime or API changes — existing installs and imports are unaffected.

- Updated dependencies [940847a]
  - @tour-kit/license@1.0.1
